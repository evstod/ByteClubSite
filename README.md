##Archived Project

This was a project created an independent study of .NET Core and the asset pipeline.

This is a website featuring a blog with editable pages and a class schedule display that updates and refreshes every period.

The site is designed to be hosted on Microsoft Azure with a Microsoft SQL Database controlling user accounts, blog posts, and class schedules. The project uses .NET Core 3.1 Framework with Razor Pages for the user interface.
